# Fire Detection API Project Challenges

In this project, you'll be tasked with designing and developing a neural network that can run in production as a basic image classifier.

To get full credit on this project, you'll have to accomplish at least three major objectives:
- Create at least two image classifier models as discrete versions of your project.
    - First version should comprise a multilayered perceptron-based network.
    - Second version should comprise a convolutional neural network.
- Deploy at least one classifier online and test it with sample image uploads.
- Finish all required objectives and at least 50% of all bonus objectives.

For the sake of clarity, all objectives (both required and bonus) will be identified per subdirectory and file.
